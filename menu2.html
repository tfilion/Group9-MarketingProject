			food in India is integral to spiritual advancement, it is joy and celebration.
			 The Indian kitchen varies significantly from south to north and east to west, 
			 with the southern and western Indian cuisines leading the way of vegetarian 
			 Indian food as most Westerners have come to know and love it. 
			 It in the north and northeast, the Muslim influence of the Mughals with its 
			 meaty traditions can still be felt, as well 
			 as the glowing Tandoor of Punjab. Despite an immense fruit and vegetable variety in 
			 a land as large as Alaska, Texas and California 
			 combined (the three largest states in the USA), the core of any Indian meal is grain:
			  rice in the south and wheat in the form of roti
			  or naan (bread) in the north, and they both are eaten with daal (lentils or pulses).</p>
